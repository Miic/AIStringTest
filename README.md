# WholesomeChatClient

This is a prototype for a Desktop Client application. 
This takes advantage of several AIs including IBM Watson and Jigsaw Perspective.

The purpose of this is to display the concept of a self-moderating chat client using Artificial Intelligence and algorithms such as Flesch Readability Measure algorithm.

Please note: For safety issues, API Keys are NOT included in our Repository. Those interested of this may request access for a working model (particularly if you are reviewing this repository for a job opportunity), or directly request API access from both IBM and Jigsaw.
